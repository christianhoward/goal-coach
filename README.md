# goal-coach
This is my goal tracking app following [David Katz](http://davidtkatz.com/#/about)'s ReactJS and Redux - Mastering Web Apps Course on Udemy. This repo is used purely for learning exercises and the course content should not be interpreted as something I've created on my own.

The app allows users to sign in or sign up for an account to the app, add goals that need to be completed and allow users to mark those goals as completed. Any user can complete any goal.
